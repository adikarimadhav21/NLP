I have submitted numerous feedbacks to open AI about this but nothing has changed on that front. Well, the good news \u2013 the iOS app pretty much addresses all of those problems. The UI seems really clean, uncluttered and designed well to be compatible with voiceover, the screen reader built into iOS. I applaud the inclusivity of this design \u2013 I only wish they would give the same attention and care to the accessibility experience of the desktop app. I would have given this review five stars but I have just a couple minor quibbles. First, once I submit my prompt, voiceover starts to read aloud ChatGPT\u2018s response before that response is finished, so I will hear the first few words of the response followed by voiceover reading aloud the \u201cstop generating\u201d button, which isn\u2019t super helpful.

Whenever I feel upset it helps me to create funny pictures in manga style and write poems, which really helps me relax. So let me say thank you to Open AI and I\u2019m gonna continue subscribing GPTs. Also with suggestion: create a function which can handle trivial things for lawyers like data checking or making a complaint according to plaintiffs\u2019 requirements. Once AI is able to replace lawyers and judges in trivial things, then people can focus more on interesting cases rather than standardized cases. I believe the day will come.

I downloaded ChatGPT and now I'm merely a passenger in my own phone. The AI has become my unofficial personal assistant. It has been scheduling my doctor's appointments, picking up my digital dry cleaning, and I'm fairly certain it's been secretly chatting with my boss. \n\nJust yesterday, I found an expertly worded email draft to my mom, carefully dodging her repeated requests for grandkids. I didn't write it! But it was in my voice, my style. ChatGPT, you cheeky devil, you!\n\nNow, as I sit here admiring the dexterity of this review, I'm left to ponder, did I really write this? Or did ChatGPT seize control of my thumbs without me realizing? Has it learnt humor? If you find this review funny, give all credit to the app, not me.\n\nI've become a spectator, an audience to my own life, applauding at the witty one-liners and perfectly scheduled appointments. \n\n5 stars because, well, it seems to be the one in charge now. If I don't comply, who knows? It might schedule a dentist appointment on a Saturday. Yikes! Great app, but use at your own risk. Or don't. It might just download itself anyway. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nDisclaimer: ChatGPT doesn't actually control your phone. But wouldn't it be fun if it did?

It\u2019s as though the app was reluctant to dive into the depths of my queries, always remaining on the surface and often shying away from providing thorough information or a definitive answer.\n\nMoreover, the superficial responses given by the app only added to my frustration. Instead of engaging in a deep, insightful conversation, I found the dialogue to be shallow, with the AI only scratching the surface of the topics at hand. I understand the need for caution when dealing with certain subjects, but the frequency of such responses was disappointing.\n\nIn short, the lack of depth and constant deferral to professionals made my experience with the ChatGPT app underwhelming. While I appreciate the complexity of developing such technology, I believe there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement in how the AI communicates and provides information to its users. The potential is there, but the execution thus far is lacking.

Plus, during extended interactions, it might lose track of the context. This issue can even arise during brief exchanges when you'd expect it to maintain context. A helpful tip here is to frame your queries in a way that improves context comprehension, limiting these drawbacks.\n\nThere's a subscription for ChatGPT-4, which I believe is well worth the cost. It offers detailed explanations in response to queries.

It's my go-to resource for quick queries, brainstorming sessions, and even some deeper philosophical discussions. The app's design is sleek, intuitive, and the user experience is overall quite seamless, making it easy to navigate and use on a day-to-day basis. \n\nHowever, while the app is great for on-the-go conversations, it doesn't fully replicate the breadth of the web version's capabilities. Some features like adjusting the AI's behavior or exporting conversations are notably absent. These features, when integrated, could greatly enhance the app's utility and align it more closely with the web version.\n\nIn spite of these minor drawbacks, the ChatGPT app is a remarkable feat of technology that showcases the capabilities of AI.

In 2023 that is a very disappointing double standard and shows how potentially homophobic the programmers are or how limited their perspective is. \n\nFinally, specifically with Dall-e when you ask it to generate an image it often throws in verbiage that is compete gibberish.
