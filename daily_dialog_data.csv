Say  Jim  how about going for a few beers after dinner
You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness
What do you mean  It will help us to relax
Do you really think so  I dont  It will just make us fat and act silly  Remember last time
I guess you are rightBut what shall we do  I dont feel like sitting at home
I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends
Thats a good idea  I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpongPerhaps we can make a foursome with them
Sounds great to me  If they are willing  we could ask them to go dancing with usThat is excellent exercise and fun  too
GoodLet  s go now
All right
Can you do pushups
Of course I can  Its a piece of cake  Believe it or not  I can do 30 pushups a minute
Really  I think thats impossible
You mean 30 pushups
Yeah
Its easy  If you do exercise everyday  you can make it  too
Can you study with the radio on
No  I listen to background music
What is the difference
The radio has too many comerials
Thats true  but then you have to buy a record player
Are you all right
I will be all right soon  I was terrified when I watched them fall from the wire
Dont worryHe is an acrobat
I see
Hey John  nice skates  Are they new
Yeah  I just got them  I started playing ice hockey in a community league  So  I finally got myself new skates
What position do you play
I  m a defender  It  s a lot of fun  You don  t have to be able to skate as fast on defense
Yeah  you  re a pretty big guy  I play goalie  myself
Oh  yeah  Which team
The Rockets
Really  I think we play you guys next week  Well  I have to go to practice  See you later
All right  see you later
Hey Lydia  what are you reading
I  m looking at my horoscope for this month  My outlook is very positive  It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic  and that I will have a passionate summer fling
What are you talking about  Let me see that  What are horoscopes
It  s a prediction of your month  based on your zodiac sign  You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in  I was born on April 15th  so I  m an Aries  When were you born
January 5th
Let  s see    you  re a Capricorn  It says that you will be feeling stress at work  but you could see new  exciting developments in your love life  Looks like we  ll both have interesting summers
That  s bogus  I dont feel any stress at work  and my love life is practically nonexistent  This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense
No  it  s not  your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality  See  It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize
Well  you certainly match those criteria  but they  re so broad they could apply to anyone  What does it say about me
A Capricorn is seriousminded and practical  She likes to do things in conventional ways  That sounds just like you
Frank  s getting married  do you believe this
Is he really
Yes  he is  He loves the girl very much
Who is he marring
A girl he met on holiday in Spain  I think
Have they set a date for the wedding
Not yet
I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs
That  s right  we bought it the same day we came on the market
What kind of house is it
It  s a wonderful Spanish style
Oh  I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses
And it  s a bargaining  A house like this in river side costs double the price
Great  is it a two bedroom house
No  it has three bedrooms and three beds  and has a living room with a twelvefoot ceiling  There  s a twocar garage
That  s a nice area too  It  ll be a good investment for you
Yeas  when will you buy a house
Not untill the end of this year  you know  just before my wedding
Right  congratulations
Thank you
Hi  Becky  whats up
Not much  except that my motherinlaw is driving me up the wall
Whats the problem
She loves to nitpick and criticizes everything that I do  I can never do anything right when shes around
For example
Well  last week I invited her over to dinner  My husband and I had no problem with the food  but if you listened to her  then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables  Theres just nothing can please her
No  I cant see that happening  I know youre a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen
Its not just that  She also criticizes how we raise the kids
My motherinlaw used to do the same thing to us  If it wasnt disciplining them enough  then we were disciplining them too much  She also complained about the food we fed them  the schools we sent them too  and everything else under the sun
You said she used to  How did you stop her
We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing  and how we welcomed her advice but hoped shed let us do our things  She understood  and now everything is a lot more peaceful
That sounds like a good idea  Ill have to try that
How are Zinas new programmers working out
I hate to admit it  but theyre good  And fast  The Filipino kid is a genius
So youll make the Starscom deadline  and have us up and running next week
Itll be close  but well make it
Good  After Starscom starts paying us  we wont need Vikams cash anymore
And if we dont need them  we wont need Zina  either
Do you like cooking
Yes  I like cooking very much  I got this hobby when I was 12 years sold
Why do you like it
I have no idea  I like cooking by myself  I like to taste delicious food
Thats wonderful
And I love trying new recipes  which I usually test with my friends  You can come  too
Really  I hope I can have a chance to taste it  Dont forget to tell me
Certainly
Anyone home  Jen
Im in the kitchen  let yourself in
Wow  Youre really working up a storm
I know  Ive even worked up a sweat
You look like a cooking show hostonly messier
You look so tan and healthy
Thanks  I just got back from summer camp
How was it
Great  I got to try so many things for the first time
Like what
I went sailing  fishing  and horseback riding
I  m so jealous
The counselors were so nice too  It was the best summer ever  Except for all those mosquitoes
Diana  do you like the perfume I gave you
It  s good  But to tell you the truth  I don  t wear perfume
I  m sorry  I didn  t know that
That  s all right  Thank you all the same
Ah  ah  ah

Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthyShe is always making us kids eat the proper foods
Well  it pays off for herHow old is she anyway
She will be 86 next month
That is truly amazing

Hi  my name is Lean  and Im from Russia
Nice to meet you  Lean  My name is Alike  Im from Japan
To me English is a difficult language
A second language is always difficult
True  but English is harder than most  Its a crazy language
A crazy language  Why do you say that
One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings
No wonder you say English is a crazy language
Can I help you
I hope so  Im looking for some material for a paper Im writing  and Im not quite sure where to look
Ill certainly try to help you  What topic is your paper on
My paper is on the influence of television on children
There are several possible sources you might use for that topic  I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television
Thank you for you help
Here  s your hot dog and beer  What happened  Did I miss anything
Yeah  Cal Ripen just hit a home run
What  s the score
Well it was 3 to 4  but Ripen  s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base
So Baltimore is winning
Right
This is a really great place to watch a baseball game
Yeah  there isn  t a bad seat in the place
The fans are great here  too  Not like in Philadelphia
It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game

Sure  Which button do I press to shoot
This one
Do I have to focus it
No  this is a focusfree camera  All you have to do is point and press the button
All right  Say cheese
Every country should face the history
Yeah  we don  t live in the vacuum  We have traditional values and long but different history
Sometimes  we  human beings  really had done something wrong  so we should admit it at first
But there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history
I believe such things won  t be realized  just daydreaming
Do you like traveling  Kathy
I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance  But I don  t like traveling to work  waiting for buses  or
Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you  re driving
Exactly
Your house is too small  Why not buy a big one
I do wish I could afford one
You can get a loan from the bank  You know LPF program provides low cost loans for participants home purchases
Of course I know that  But dont you notice that the house price is skyrocketing
How do you do  ProfSmith
How do you do  Ms  YangYou speak very good English

White  please
Look  theres a Folk concert tomorrow evening  Do you Want to go

Hey  Ted  What are you up to this Friday
Well  I have the day off from work
That  s great  Do you have any plans
Well  I  Ve been working so hard lately  so I  ll probably just take it easy
Sounds nice
Yeah  I  ll probably just stay in and relax  Maybe watch a few movies
Can I stop by
Sure  Any time
You honestly believe the world  s improving every year
Yes  I do  I think that science is making us wiser  What do you think
I don  t think you  re right there
I believe industry is making us wealthier
I don  t believe that
And in my opinion  medicine is making us healthier
I agree with you in the sense  But we  re all more miserable than ever  aren  t we
I don  t agree with you  I maintain that we  re healthier  wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago
That  s your opinion not mine
What do you plan to do for your birthday
I want to have a picnic with my friends  Mum
How about a party at home  That way we can get together and celebrate it
OK  Mum  Ill invite my friends home
How may I help you
I would like to return this book
Is that all you need
I also want to check out this video
Is that all you would like to check out
That  s all I need
Do you have your library card
Here it is
Make sure to take proper care of this video
That won  t be a problem
If you damage the video  you will be fined
I won  t damage it
Whats the matter with you then  You look miserable
Its us
What do you mean by us
Well  you always say youre busy
Thats right
And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself
I  I  I miss my parents  also they miss me
Oh I remember  I cut terrible calls  and you didnt say anything about it
You mean I am groaned a few words
Totally not  Perhaps its about our marriage
Hi  Mary  You look pale today  Whats the matter with you
I think Ive caught a cold  Now Im aching all over
Youd better take some medicine and have a good rest  I hope youll be yourself pretty soon
Thank you  I suppose I should go to see a doctor
I feel like going for a drink  its been a long day
Great idea  Peter  I could use the drink
How about the new bar across road
Sounds good  The food there is fantastic  too
I agree  I had lunch there last week
excellent  That sounds like a plan
Could you tell me the right time  please
Well  My watch says five past two  But it  s no use rely on it because it has been gaining and losing these last a few days
You have to go and fix it
Yes  I will
does your family have a record of your ancestors
sure  My mom has been working on our family tree for years  She  s always updating it
do you have a copy of your family tree in your house  I  d love to see it
I can show it to you now  if you like  I think it goes back about 8 generations so far
that  s amazing  Do you have a large extended family
I  Ve got 30 cousins on my mom  s side and 10 cousins on my dad  s side
are you very close to your firstcousins
the ones that are my age are close relatives  Now that I  m older  I don  t spend as much time with them as I used to  so I don  t know my younger cousins as well as the older ones
I see  who  s the head of your household
it  s definitely my mother  And  her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family
that  s interesting  What does your grandfather think of your stepmother
at first  she was quite critical of her  but now that they  Ve been married for a few years  she  s starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother
that  s pretty much how you feel about your stepmother  Like grandmother  like grandson
Hi  Mr  Wang  Do you feel like going boating with me
Sounds interesting  I havent gone boating for some time now  and what time
How about tomorrow afternoon
Sure  Where shall I meet you
At the gate of the park
Great  I look forward to meeting you
See you then
See you
I hear that youve been to the Saikei Ski Resort for the weekend  Did you enjoy it
Yes  its so exciting  though I had the most falls in our skiing team
Isnt there any coach to teach you how to ski
Of course there is  The toplevel coaches there are from the State Sports General Administration
Could you move smoothly
YesMy face even ached in the icy wind
What happened afterwards
I was skiing on and on excitedly until I realized one thingI could not stop  You can just imagine how terrified I was
Poor girl
You look pale recently
Yeah  I have got much pressure in the company  I have tobe wrapped upon my work
Take good care of yourself
Thank you  I will
Hey  Maggy  Did you hear about David
About David  No  I didn  t hear anything
You know  about David and his new boss
Sorry  I don  t quite follow you
Well  I heard David has been fired
Oh  that is a shame  He is really hard working
how do you usually get to school
I usually ride my bike  Which form of transport do you prefer to use
I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle  but when I feel lazy  I drive my car
I think we should discourage people from using their private cars  They produce too much pollution
I agree  but I would find it difficult to stop using my car  Its just so convenient
cars might be convenient  but theyre so bad for the environment
do you have a car
no  I used to have one though  Once I started using my bicycle to get around  I found that I didnt really need it
maybe if I sold my car now  I wouldnt be so tempted to use it
you could try  It would save you a lot of money
thats true  Every month  I spend hundreds of dollars on gas  insurance  and repairs
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving  you will get lots of exercise  too
I could stand to lose a few pounds  Having a car has made me lazy  I never end up walking anywhere
lets go to a car dealership  Ill help you try to sell your car for a good price
sounds good  Lets go
Whats wrong with him
His nose is out of joint because we forgot to invite him to the party
What are you going to do for one year abroad  Tom
Study  study  study  I want to learn a lot
You are going to take courses
Yes  I am going to take some university courses there
Sounds hard
Yes  but I think its probably for the best
Won  t you get lonely
Hey  I am a pretty cool guy  I will make friends  and Ill have a lot of extracurricular activities too  You know  like fencing  or theater or something
Isnt this lovely weather  Will you help me water the flowers  Jack
Well  do you think I have to
I doWe havent watered them for quite a few days
Please look at the skyDon  t you see the dark clouds  Its going to rain soon
GoodSo we dont have to workHow nice
But I dont think its so nice
Why
The weather report says its going to rain for a whole week
Oh  Im afraid all the flowers will die in the rain
On  darn  The grocery store is closed
Yeah  this one closes at ten  We could drive to the 24  hour store on sixth
Alright  We are out of everything
I wish the store close to us was open 24  house a day
I know  our schedules are so weird  Sometimes  the little corner store is the only thing within walking distance that  s open when we get home
Yeah  and the prices there are very high
I know  Three dollars for milk
Do you think they two will get married
You can count on it
I think soYes  they get along so well
I like himHe  s good for her
Youre right  He sure is
Dad  where are we off to
First we will go to the city centre and stop for something to drink  Then we will visit the University Museum
Where are we going to have a drink
There is a coffee shop round the corner  Can you see that big building at the end of the road
Yes
That is a bank  The coffee shop is opposite the bank
Good  I will have hot chocolate
A stop  Wait for the lights to turn green
When crossing the road you must always pay attention to whats around you
Sorry  How far is the museum
I am not sure  We will ask for directions in the coffee shop
Here we are  You find us a table and Ill get the drinks
How about going to the cinema tonight
Thats great  Whats on tonight
I am not sure about the name of the film  but I know its a romantic one
Romantic  I am afraid I like thrillers better
Dont you think its too bloody
On the contrary  very exciting
I feel so uncomfortable
Are you sick
No  The teacher is dragging the chalk over the blackboard  It set my teeth on edge
He  ll finish writing in a minute
I have made up my mind  I am getting a tattoo
Really  Are you sure
Yeah  Why not  They are trendy and look great  I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back
Yeah but  it is something that you will have forever  They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment  On top of all that  I have heard it hurts a lot
Really
Of course  They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink
Oh  I didn  t know that  I thought they just paint it on your skin or something
I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos  Also  find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles  and that the place is hygienic
Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing
Excuse me  whats the screen near your steering wheel for
Its a portable TV  Its a popular thing now
Oh  thats new to me  So whats on everyday
News about current affairs  documentaries  music  movies  noncommercial ads and so on
Is there anything interesting
Yes  there are something good and informative  I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education
I agree  Are there any commercials on the TV
Of course  Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs
That makes a lot of sense  Does the TV work well
Not always  It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals
I got it  Do you pay for the programs
Yes  50 Yuan per month
Oh  no
How dreadful
Look at the view from the window
Oh  dear  That  s terrible  Not at all what I expected
It  s awful  isn  t it
I can  t bear to look at it  I  m rather disappointed
It can  t be helped
What do you do in your free time  Nancy
Well  I like playing the violin
Really  How long have you been playing the violin
About ten years so far  I started learning when I was in middle school
Thats really interesting
Sure  So what about you  Do you have any hobbies
Well  I like collecting matchbox  Im not sure if that counts  though
Of course it does  Everybody has his own hobby
How can I tell her about this
Dont worry  youll find a way
There is no need to be so frustrated
How can you live without job in the future
Dont worry  youll find a way
What sports do you like to play
I like baseball and basketball
How about football
In my country football is brand new  so I never learned the game when I was younger
Its a very popular game in America
Yeah  I heard a lot about it  Is it really that fun
For me  its one of those games that are fun to both watch and play
Are you a football player
No  I just for fun with my friends  We play two hand touch or flag football  Were too old to play tackle football
What is two hand touch and flag football
Instead of tackling somebody  you just have to touch them with two hands  or if it is flag football  grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing
I see  Its safer then right
Exactly  We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts  If you want to learn and play a little  youre welcome to join us
Ill give it a try  Give me a call and lets go down together
Ok  Ill call you Saturday morning
Great
What upsets you
My parents called  As usual  they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s  Easier said then done  Who should I marry  I have no time to go on a date
It is not your mother finding one for you
I will find one myself  of course  I  m a modern girl
Perhaps you can try the three minutes date  the latest type
You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol  I hate that idea
No  there is an updated virgin  three minutes video date  I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam  you can sigh for it  You can be facetoface with a guy talking for maximum three minutes
I don  t think it makes sense  Three minutes is such a short time
I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone  socalled love at first sight
Anyway  I don  t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that
Don  t worry  There are many other options using the internet as dating methods  Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications  Of course  for these sites  you have to pay a membership fee  But all in all  it is more serious and professional  The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher
I don  t want to post my personal information on the internet  I  m not knowing who is reading it
Are you going to the party on Saturday
I was thinking about it  Are you
Yeah  I heard its going to be a lot of fun
Really  Well  what time does it start
It starts at 8
Well  who all is going to be there
Everyone from school
How do you know its going to be so fun
This party is going to have a DJ  food  and drinks
Wow  that does sound like its going to be fun
So am I going to see you at the party
Yeah  I will be there
Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades
Step into my office for a moment  What is your concern
Am I failing
Lets go on the computer to see whats up  Do you think you are doing well
I am pretty sure that I am in trouble
I can see that you are trying  but where do you think you could improve
I missed a few classes  I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis
Having a regular study routine and following it is very important  right
Ill try  its hard
Thanks for stopping by
Good luck on your test tomorrow  Well be crossing our fingers for you
Thanks
Ill never ever work together with him
What happened  Quarrel again
Will you take my materials back from him for me  Please
Dont ask me  I dont wanna be involved in your quarrel
Oh  my God  Ive been cheated
What  What did you buy
Its a brick  I cant believe how stupid I was  Damn it
What is it  Why did you buy a brick
There was a guy on the sidewalkHe had three new boxes  Panasonic video camera boxesHe said he had to get rid of them quick
And
So he said hed sell me one for twenty dollars  A fourhundreddollar camera for twenty bucks
And its a brick
Yes
I cant believe how stupid you are  Why didnt you open the box
I wanted to  But he said  no  the box is still in its plastic wrap from the storeIf its opened  other people wont believe its new
So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic
Yes  it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new productsLook  it even had a barcode price sticker on it  It looked brand new
But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars
He said he had to get rid of them  They were stolen
Aha  Now I understandYou were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalkSo  what I think is  you deserve to get cheated
Cmon  dont blame me  I thought it was a new camera  We could use itWe were even thinking about buying a camera  I dont understand how he could have such a perfectlooking box
Thats no problemHe just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap  Thats easyAnd probably its the same shop he got the boxes fromMaybe his friend works in an electronics store  They sell video cameras thereProbably they had a couple video camera boxes lying aroundSo they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like youTwenty dollars a brick  Thats a good profit if they can sell enough bricks
Youre right  Sarah  I was a fool  I cant believe it  How could I fall for such a trick
Is the clock right
Im afraid it gains a little
By how many minutes
Two
Hey  Mary  whats up
Just so so  Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time  so we decided to meet again tonight
Oh  thats exciting  What does this guy look like  Is he hot
Well  I didnt think so at first  But as we started talking  I found him extremely funny and witty  I couldnt stop laughing at his jokes  And we have so much in common  We like the same team  music  and most amazingly  we both love Chinese food  I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends
It seems you two are a good match  What qualities do you look for in a friend
Theres nothing definite I think  I dont have a list or anything  but when I first meet somebody  I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend  It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends
Well  thats something Ive never heard of  But if you ask me what I value most in a friend  I would say honesty
I agree  You cant expect a close relationship with a dishonest person  Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need
Yeah  I know  A friend in need is a friend indeed  I dont need fairweather friends either
What  s up  You don  t look too good
Yeah  my head hurts  that  s all  I  Ve been in physics class all day  It  s killer
I liked physics  It  s all math  really  arcs  curves  velocity  cool stuff
Yeah  yeah  but today  s lesson was all about the creation of the universe
A physics class about the creation of the universe  That  s some pretty unscientific language there  Sounds more religious to me
It  s all religion  Take the theory of the Big BangHow is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion  That  s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff
Turtles  Whatever  Look  all that  s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and antiparticles  At least  that  s what the math says
Math  sheath  What  s the evidence
There is evidence  You know Edwin Hubble  He  s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe  thus advancing notions of an expanding universe  What would it be expanding from  Well  the Big Bang  DUH
Anyway  it  s just a theory  Why do people go around touting theories  Where  s the scientific rigor in that
Dude  don  t equivocate  A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing  You slept through class  didn  t you
Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning  But people have different views about lifelong learning  How do you understand lifelong learning
I think lifelong learning is the concept that its never too soon or too late for learning
Does that mean studying all the time
I dont think so  I think its about your attitude towards learning  One should be open to new ideas  decisions  skills or behaviors
Then the axiom   You cant teach an old dog new tricks  doesnt work any longer
Youre right  Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts
Yes  I agree with you  When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active
Me too  To keep up with the changing world  one must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things
You know what  Ive recently been teaching myself French
Really  Thats great  I know that your company has a lot of clients in France
Yes  so I want to learn French to develop my career
How old are you
Nine  but Ill be ten on May 1stWhen is your birthday
Im older than you  Ill be ten on April 14th
Are you going to have a birthday party
Maybe  Ill have to ask my mother
It smells like an ashtray in here
Hi honey  What  s wrong  Why do you have that look on your face
What  s wrong  I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking
No  I said I was going to cut down which is very different  You can  t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight
Look  there are other ways to quit  You can try the nicotine patch  or nicotine chewing gum  We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place  It  s not like you can just light up like before
I know  I know  I am trying but  I don  t have the willpower to just quit  I can  t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch  Please understand
Fine  I want a divorce
Why are you shivering
Its freezing
It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy
I get antsy not because you praise a guy  but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him
How come you think of him that way
Because you seem to have lost your vigilance  You should be on the watch out
I have no reason to distrust him  Hes never caused any harm
Isnt there anything that sounds fishy
Nothing smells a rat  I told you that hes an allright guy
Allright guy  All right  Lets talk about something else instead
Cheese  It tastes like cardboard
I think so  Maybe that  s why it  s cheap here
Have you signed up to join the company  s Christmas party
Sure  I have  Will you join
I will  You know  as a newcomer  I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere
You are right  Our company  s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better  It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking
I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there
No  it will not be formal at all  It is a fun time  You will love the game show  Please dress casually  Usually there is an over abandon of drinks  so be careful with that
Don  t worry  I can handle that  And I know if the boss is there  even it is an informal evening  it does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him
If the weathermans predictions are accurate  it should rain tomorrow
I hope not  Then wed have to reschedule our baseball game
hi  Emily  do you know that guy over there
The tall one  Sure  thats Drive  he works with Lily
He is cuteWhat dose he do
Im not sure  he is a manager I think
Really  Are you going to introduce us
Well  he has already taken you know  thats his wife right there
You didnt ring me last night  You said you would
Im sorry to have made you disappointed
Thats all right  But why were you so rude to me at lunch
Was I  Sorry  I didn  t mean to be  I do apologize
And why are you yarning now  Are you bored
Forgive me darling  Im very tired
Hi  Nicole  Did you have a good weekend
Yes  I did  But I feel tired today
Really  Why
Well  on Saturday I cleaned the house and played tennis  Then on Sunday I hiked in the country
And I bet you studied  too
Yeah  I studied on Sunday evening  What about you
Well  I didnt clean the house and I didnt study  I stayed in bed and watched TV
That sounds like fun  but did you exercise
Sort of  I played golf on my computer
There will be a parade to celebrate National Day this weekend
Whats the route
From Zhongshan Circus to City Bank
If only I could join it
Excuse me  Im afraid youre in my seat  Youve moved my books
Oh  dear
You must have realized somebody was here
Oh  well  I looked around  There wasnt any other space  I waited a while and nobody came  Im sorry if Ive taken your place
What  s the life expectancy in your country
I  m not sure  but probably about 75 years  How about in your country
About 70  I think  This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population  It  s a problem that will soon affect most of the world
I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age  because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly
Perhaps we need to have more babies  Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday
Did she  That  s great  However  if we have too many children  that will have a bad effect on the enviroment
How  s your son these days
Oh  he  s fine  Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays
He  ll be a teenager before you know it  Teenagers are often rebellious  When do you mine it is a good age to have a child
I had mine when I was 24  that  s a little young  I  d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties   or even in your early thirties if you have a good career
Yes  I think you  re right  I  m thinking about having a child  but not just yet
Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country
Yes  there is  Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives  They want to go out  have fun  and explore the world  They want to develop their own view of life  Parents usually try to discourage them  but they don  t often succeed
Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country  Sometimes they give them too much freedom
It  s almost impossible to get the right balance  If you are too strict  kids might ignore you  If you are too lenient  they might go wild
Im going to Japan this year on vacation
Have you ever been to America
No  but Id really like to
Youd like it
Hey  Mark  long time no see
Julie  Its good to see you again  How have you been
Great  I just got back from a weeks vacation in Thailand
Really  How was it
Fantastic  I didnt want to come back
I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful
They are  And not only that the people are friendly  but also the food is delicious  not to mention cheap
I do like Thai food  Did you see much of Bangkok
Not much  Ive got enough city life in Beijing
I know what you mean  I could use a vacation myself
Hey  wouldnt it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime
Yeah  it sure would
Could I see the manager please  I have a complaint to make
Yes  I  m the manager here  What can I do for you  Madam
Did you have the room checked before we move in
Which room are you in
1808  The toilet doesn  t work properly  the water doesn  t run in the shower
I  m awfully sorry to hear that  I  ll turn to it right away
Congratulations  Vivian  You won the grand prize  again
Isnt it just great  I just knew Id win
You did  How  Did you wear red underwear again this year
Not only that
Tell me  Tell me  Whats your secret
OK  OK  Ill whisper it to you  but you have to promise not to tell anyone
What   You did that
We are going to the concert this evening  Will you join us
Im very sorry I cant
Why not
Ive been snowed under with since my bosses away on business
Youv been work here for nearly a month  how do you feel about the job
Not badThank you for your help  I am always busy with this job  I feel a bit tired
I had the same feeling when I first came to work here  but after a period of time  I feel better  I am sure you  ll get used to this busy job
I also feel that work efficiency here is very high  and you have strong working ability and professional skill  it seems that you know all  thats really wonderful
You know the phrase  the survival the fittest  We have no choices
Thats right  I have to work hard
The music is onMay I have the pleasure to dance with you
Sorry  Im engaged for the foxtrotWill the next Walls be all right
Certainly
Excuse me  is this seat taken
No  please feel free
Thanks a lot
Do you work in Shanghai
Yes I do  How about you
No  Im a tourist  This place is amazing  Its much bigger than I imagined  and much more exciting  Theres so much to see here
You can say that again  Its much more modern than people imagine  Where are you from
Um  well lets see  Im from Kansas originally  A much quieter and more peaceful place than here  thats for sure
Uh huh
Look at this headline  Soo Mi
Wow  So many people in the United States get divorced
Is it the same in Korea
I dont think so  In Korea some marriages break up  but most couples stay together
Do people get married young
Not really  Very few people get married beforethe age of 20
Hmm  Do women usually work after they get married
No  a lot of women stay home and take care of their families  But some work
Boy  What a beauty  I fall in love with her at the first sight
The beauty under the tree
Of courseNo girl is more charming
She is a young man
Excuse meWhere do I register
Oh  over there in Pacific Pavilion
Is that the large  white building
Yeah  thats it
Thanks
How was your education going on in Australia
Im going to graduate this summer
Where are you going to work then  in Australia or back in China
Im planning to return to China after graduation
Why are you choosing to leave a foreign country  Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad
Well  I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment
Yeah  Chinas developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country
Do you have any particular hobbies  Tom
Oh  yes  I love playing badminton  table tennis and computer games  And playing the games has become my favorite
I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers  And they dont care about their own health at all  How about you
Im no better than them  They say its mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time  but I think its stimulating
You wont play online games full of violence  will you
Once in a while
Its no good  And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time  You might as well do something healthy and meaningful
I hope I can practice selfcontrol again
What  s the plot of your new movie
It  s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders  I play the part of the detective  He has to catch the killer  but there  s very little evidence  It  s a psychological th
Did you enjoy making the movie  We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director
I have had disagreement with every director  I  Ve worked with  We  Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences  It was the same when I made this movie  I don  t no
Critics are not very happy with the movies that you  Ve made recently  Does that bother you
Not at all  The feedback from audience has been great  I care about what they think more than what the critics think
Did you do you own stunts in the movie
I wanted to  but my insurance company wouldn  t let me  All of my stunts were done by a stuntman  As you know  I used to do my own stunts  but I  ll leave that to the experts in future
Thank you very much for doing this interview
My pleasure  Have you seen the movie yet
Yes  I have  I liked it very much  Like you  I was very impressed with Rachel  s performance in the movie  She  s going to be a star
Whos that old lady trimming the trees
Shes my grandma
Shes looks very healthyHow old is she
92
Mom  My legs are killing me
Hold on  We will be successful right away
Oh  man  I had the best supper last night  My wife made a stirfry and it was amazing
I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce  Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts  Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger  Mmm  Mmm  It  s almost lunchtime  I would die for a plate of stir fry right now
Well  you can keep the vegetables  I  ll take the meat  The stir fry my wife made was really hearty  with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion
What  You call that a stir fry  More meat than vegetables  That  s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry  What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in  What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap
What did you say
I said its a lovely day  Why dont we go for a walk
Well  I feel a little tired
Come on  A little labor  much health
Then can you wait a few minutes  I want to finish writing this letter
Dont take too long  It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather
I wont be long  No more than ten minutes  Why dont you go ahead and Ill meet you in the park
I Believe I will  Look for me near the lake
Thank god you showed up when you did  He  s insane  Do you think we should call the police
Don  t worry about it  I  ll call my friend and have him take care of it  I can  t believe he was stalking you all these years  What a nut job
I know  Well  he said I  m not pregnant  I  m sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing  I want you to know that I didn  t do it on purpose
Don  t apologize  From the moment I met you  not a day has gone by when I haven  t thought of youAnd now that I  m with you again  I  m  I  m just scared  Veronica  The closer I get to you  the worse it gets  The thought of not being with you  I mean  I just can  t handle it  We were made for each other  Veronica  You are my everything  my soul mate  What can I do
Just hold me  I  ll always be here for you  no matter what  And together  we can tackle whatever life throws at us  I believe in us  steven
I  m so happy to hear that  I knew we belong together  I love you so much
Zina  can I talk to you about something personal
As long as it doesnt take too long
My boyfriend says I work too much  That I spend more time with you than with him
Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend
He said not to bother coming back  And I said  fine  I wont
So whats the problem
Mary  how was your date with john
its ok  It seems we have a lot in common
oh  really  That is great news  What does he look like
he is tall and slim  fairhaired
sounds like he is pretty cute  What do you think of him
he is a nice guy and very considerate  I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor
oh  its love at first sight  When will you see each other again
he didnt say  but he said he would call me
maybe he is busy with his work  Just wait and try not to think about it too much
oh  steve  Stop it  I am a bit nervous  What if he doesnt call
come on  Mary  youre a total catch  I bet he will call you  Dont worry
thank you  Steve  Youre always so encouraging
thats what friends are for
Hi  Francis  how was your business trip
It was a nightmare
What  s up
Actually  the business trip itself was very successful  We arrived on time  we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year
Sounds quite fruitful  why do you call it still a nightmare then
Well  the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge  I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam  When I finally got home  I was totally exhausted  But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout
This is really a sad story  Did they trace back your luggage
I am still waiting for their call
Take it easy  all sufferings have their reward
So the company decided to cancel your trip to Hong Kong
Yes  The SARS epidemic is not under effective control yet  So Id better not risk it
Maybe its a good things  If you dont have to go to Hong Kong  you can take a break and take things easy for a while
You are right  Maybe we should work out a fitness plan and start to do more exercise  Sitting around in the office all day is no way of keeping fit
Thats a good idea  Lets see if we can get more people in this plan  There isnt much business these days anyway  so I think many people will be interested
Which pair of jeans do you like best
I really like the straight legs
But they arent very fashionable  What about these
I dont like the way they sag down  I feel like I have plumber butt in them
Thats the style  You just wear boxers
What if someone got it in their head to give them a tug  What then
Youre so old fashioned  Nobody is going to pull down your pants
If you ask me  its a walking invitation
Hi  Charles  Whats the matter
Oh   My car isnt working  Im waiting for a towtruck
Do you have a ride home
Yes  my wife is coming to get me
Thats good  Do you live near here
No  we live in the suburbs  What about you
I live downtown  with my parents
Do you have a car
I dont need a car  I walk to work
Youre lucky
Happy anniversary  sweetheart
Yes  to our first anniversary and many more to come  Cheers
Ill drink to that  Thanks for making this a night worth remembering
Well  its a special day  They say if you survive the first year  the rest is smooth sailing
Thats good to know  Oh  listen  The bands playing our song
I requested it  What do you say  Do you have your dancing shoes on
Always
What do you plan to do for your birthday
I want to have a picnic with my friends  Mum
How about a party at home  That way we can get together and celebrate it
OK  Mum  Ill invite my friends home
How about seconds  Victor
Nothanks  Im full
Why dont you have dinner with me tonight
Id love to
Lets say about 600
Thats OK with me
Cigarette
Oh  uh  Thanks  Henry  do you have a light
Sorry  here
Thanks  Lovely day  Pity I  m on duty
I  ll stand in with you if you like  I  Ve got nothing else to do
Oh  no  I couldn  t possibly
Hi Rose  what are you busy with right now
Hi Jack  Im working on these documents  The manager wants them for half an hour
Well  Rose
Is there something any need
Are your free this weekend
Yes  I have nothing to do
Great  Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend
I beg your pardon
Id like to call on you this weekend  I just want to a drop in for a chat
Really  well  ok  youre welcome
Is 5 PM  Saturday a good time for you
Hmm  how about seven  I can treat you to dinner
Sure  that would be great  Ill bring the wine
OK  Then Ill be expecting you
Ill be there on time
How do you shoot pool
You have 16 balls on the table  7 solid colored  7 striped colored  a black 8 ball  and the white ball
And
You hit the white ball with your cue  The white ball hits the colored balls  And you want to get the colored balls into the pockets
How do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one
At the beginning  it does not matter  but once someone gets one ball in  it is set
Can I get the black ball in
The black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets
Lets go and try now
How about going to hear a countryandwestern singer tonight
Id enjoy that
Ill pick you up around 8 00
OK  Ill see you then
The mosquitos are biting me
Me  too  I can  t stop scratching  They are everywhere  Sneaky little jerks
Do you have any bug spray
No  I forgot to buy some
Then we  ll have to put up with it
We can cover ourselves with beer  That way if they bite us  they  ll get drunk and fall asleep
That  s without a doubt  the best idea you  Ve had  Let  s do it
Run  They are thirsty for more
Stop running around in front of the TV  will you  Why dont you just sit and watch
Ive tried  but I cant stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program
Then stay away  No one is keeping you from doing that
Dont be so irritable  I just dont understand the program  thats all
All right  I will explain it to you later on  Now scram
Ok  I will wait until you have had your fun  if thats what you want
Thats exactly what I want  thank you
Okay  can I ask you something direct
Ha  Its not like youve ever been one to beat around the bush
Fair enough  Give it to me straight  Did she bully you into this
No  seriously    I really want this
I tell ya  when I got the invite  it really threw me for a loop  Youve done a complete 180
I know  But things have changed  I guess Ive settled down
I guess so
My daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another  She says she wants to get a better job with higher pay
It seems quite normal to me  It is pretty much what I want to do
But what about settling down to start a family  Doesnt anyone want to get married any more
It is different now  The world is becoming colorful  Some of my friends dont feel the same pressure to marry  We all want to wait for the right moment
What time is the right moment
Let the universe find us instead of forcing love  We prefer natural love  The most important thing is to be happy  Love will find us later  That is what we say
Please excuse me  but I really have to be going
Yes  of courseIt was nice to see you
It was nice to see you  tooAnd please give my regards to MrsRobbins
Excuse me  Is this seat taken
Im afraid so
What do you think of the coming match
Winning is a piece of cake to me
You are bragging again
What would you reckon the taxing increases
Well  the state will benefit a lot  I suppose
But what do most people think about it
Ah  it  s hard to say
are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night
of course  Is the dinner still on
yes  I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place
we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice
thats what I thought you would do  Listen  I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood  Its just down the street from all the bars  You probably dont want to be walking around after dark
it cant be that bad
I wish it wasnt  but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here
really  I never would have guessed  The criminals must only come out in the evenings  because Ive never noticed anything strange when Ive been at your house in the daytime
do me a favor  and take a taxi  Itd make me feel a lot better
ok  we will  How do you get around in the evenings
when I first moved in  I walked everywhere  But within a week  I had my purse stolen  just a block away from the police station  Now  I always take public transportation
has anything else happened to you
nothing else has happened to me  but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close
well  well be careful  Thanks for letting me know
Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not
Why doesnt he ask her
He is too scared to ask her
Hes a chicken guy
I dont understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit
Yeah  Li Nas mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbours daughter got married with a Canadian  Shes almost driving Li Na crazy
If I were Li Na  I would ask her if she had done that
She is as meek as a lamb  She never goes against anyone or anything  Shes as good as gold  you know
Where is John  I cant find him anywhere
Havent you heard that he is in prison
What  Beg your pardon
John is in prison nowHe was copped outstealing
I just cannt believe my ears
What do you need
I need to use the Internet
You have your library card  right
Yes  I do
There is a wait right now to use the computers
That  s fine
Would you please write your name on this list
Then what
I will call you when a computer is free
How do I log on to the computer
Use the number on the back of your library card
Thanks  I  ll be sitting over there
What a nice tie you are wearing
Thank youBut does it really look all right
CertainlyIt matches your suit perfectly
Then does it go well with my sweater
YesYou look very smart today
Thank you very much
What do you make of the case
If you ask me  I don  t think it  s guilty
What do you mean by saying so
I mean it  s not his fault
Oh  yeah
Yes  Don  t you think he should be pitied rather than accused
Happy Mothers Day  Mom
Thanks  These are beautiful  You shouldnt have
Of course I should have  You certainly deserve them  You put up with all of us
I forgot what I put up with  In that case  I do deserve these flowers
I have a real problem when I meet people
What is it  Maybe I can help
I never know when to shake hands and when not to  Can you tell me something about it
Do you come from a country where they shake hands
Oh yes  Men  women  and children shake hands all the time
It  s very simple  Men shake hands  women and children don  t
But some women do shake hands  And now a lot of children have such good manners  they shake hands too
Well  a good rule to follow is  for men you hold out your hand  for women and children  you wait and see what they do
That sounds easy enough
Sure  Once you get the hang of it  it  s a piece of cake  It  s nothing to worry about
Sam  I am so sorry  It was your birthday yesterday and I completely forgot about it
Dont worry about it  I keep forgetting everyones birthdays as well
Margaret really told me off when she found out that I had forgotten all about it  We did try to phone you  but you and Jane must have gone out
Yes  Jane invited me for dinner to this new restaurant which opened near us
Oh  yes  I know the one  How was the food
The food was excellent  but Jane ordered a birthday cake  which they forgot about  So as you can see  you were not the only one
Oh  no
Yes  Jane was quite upset about it  The manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert  but still
I would think this was the least they could do
In the end it was a nice evening and I got an iPad as my birthday present which I wanted for a while
Great  I have also been thinking of getting one  Do you think you could ask Jane to have a quiet word with Margaret  My birthday is not that far away
I can try  but knowing Margaret she will see through that immediately
Heres the restaurant were meeting the Smiths at
Lets go in to wait for them
After you
When do you usually go to the movies
I usually go in my free time on the weekends  How about you
The movie theater is always so crowded on the weekends  I like to go to the movies during the week
Thats true  And sometimes the tickets are cheaper during the week as well
Are you telling us a lie again
I will be hanged if I lying
All right  But what was the trouble
My car run out of petrol
I cant believe Mr  Fro didnt buy it  Who does that guy think he is anyway  Bill Gates
He had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked
Time to order  Balista  today I want a skinny triple latte
When did you start worrying about your weight
Im not  I just dont feel like drinking whole milk today  Why  Do you think Im fat
No  Jess  chill out
Come on  Tara  Let  s go up to the window and buy two tickets  The movie is starting in a few minutes
We can  t break into the line  Don  t be so impatient  We  ll be at the front of the line soon
Two tickets  please  How much are they
Oh no  Ari  I didn  t mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight  Let  s go Dutch  I  ll pay my own way  I insist
I  m looking forward to this film  I read a good review of it in this morning  s newspaper
Me  too  It will be great to see something light and funny for a change  I  m tired of heavy drama
Are these seats okay
They  re fine  but I can  t watch a movie without popcorn
Do you often buy magazines
I buy a computer magazine every month  It keeps me upto date with all the latest developments
Why don  t you find the information on the internet instead
Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for  Besides  I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes
Do you have an online edition of that magazine
Yes  they do  But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription
Do you have a subscription
Yes  I do  The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month  Do you every buy magazines
I only buy them if they look particularly interesting  I don  t buy any regularly
Mumm  Those burgers smell great  Its perfect day for a barbecue
It sure is  Im glad it didnt rain  My names Mike Gates  by the way
Oh  hi  Im Barbara Johnson  Nice to meet you
Im sorry  Whats your name again
Barbara  But please  just call me Barb
So Barb  what do you do
Im studying medicine
Really  Where
At Harvard  What about you
Im an engineer at IBM
Oh  are you  That sounds interesting
Yeah  I like it  Hey  it looks like the food is ready
Good  Im starving
Wow  I cant believe Im standing here
What are you so excited about
Im standing in front of an exquisite work of art
Whats the big deal  Its just a picture of some woman
Ive seen it so many times in books  but I never imagined Id get to see it in person
There are tons of other paintings that I think are better
Maybe so  but do you have any idea how much this one is worth
No  how much is it worth
About 80 million dollars
Whoa
hey  Maris  are you a parttimer
parttimer  Is that a new buzzword
oh  it  s pretty popular among my classmates these days  So are you
sure  I have a parttime job as a bartender
cool  It must be amazing to work at a bar
yeah  but I  m not there for fun  I have to remain professional and if I get distracted  the manager would be pretty upset
that  s true  I  m wondering did you learn anything from the job
of course  There  s always much to learn  I got to know more about the real world
you mean you got working experience  right
not just working experience  I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life
it must be very demanding
sometimes it is  But after working for a few weeks  it  s easy to figure out
really  It sounds interesting
maybe you can come to the bar one day and I  ll show you around
great  I  m looking forward to it
Have you seen that house
Yes  it looks interesting
Youre right  I love it very much
It must be old
At least more than 100 years old
Lets enter it
I cant open the door
It must be locked
Let me ask the old woman in that reception office
She cant answer you
She must be deaf
It must be a haunted house  Are you frightened
Frightened  You must be joking
Have you got any hobbies
Yes  Im fond of playing the chess and Im very keen on playing cards
Which is easier to learn
Both  but the rules of playing cards vary in different places
Jim  how was your weekend
I went to the beach with my friends and had a barbecue there
That sounds like a lot of fun  Did you go swimming  too
Sure  I think it  s a fantastic place to go
I couldn  t agree more  That  s an ideal place for a vacation
It sure is
I can  t wait to go there myself
Youd better prepare for the examination
I dont think the exam will be very hard
You should change your attitude  or you will not pass the course
Maybe youre right  I have been too lazy lately
It is high time you have a talk with him  That may help clear the mists
I did  but he gives me a runaround
If I were you  I would put the whole matter on the table
But he was trying to beat about the bush  And my talk with him was fruitless
What is the correct time  please
Its exactly twelve minutes past seven
When will the lecture begin
Itll begin at nine oclock sharp
Should I ask Sara to the party
I would if I were you
If he promised to help you  Im sure he will help  Hes a man of his word
You said it  I always count on him when I need his help
Last year he helped me out of trouble  too
Were having a sixties party next week  Do you want to come
What is a sixties party
You come dressed in anything from the sixties
That sounds like fun  But where can I get clothes that old
Check out your moms closet  Ill bet she still has something
Good idea  Can I bring some music from that period too
That will be great  Do you have LPs or Cds
Dont tell me you have a record player
I want to improve my handwriting  and Ive practiced it for several weeks  but nothing happened  You see  my handwriting is still bad
Oh  come on  You know its a long process  you have to be patient
I know it  but I dont know when I can make it better
A  whatever you do  the most important is perseverance  So you have to hang on there  the longer  the better  Then some day  you will find youve already made a lot of progress
Yeah  you are right  I must stop complaining and stick to it every day
Yeah  Where there is a will  there is a way
I  m so excited  mother  Oh  a new baby
My first grandchild
And my first nephew  He looks a lot like you  mum  He does
Do you think so  Well  I guess  He does look a lot like me  Oh  he  s got Richard  s eyes though
Yes  he does have Richard  s eyes  The baby even looks like you than Richard does
Well  children usually resemble their parents
It  s true  Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways  And she is shy with new people just like he is
You often like comparing children with their parents
You  re right
The music has started
How do you like this waltz
Its very nice
May I ask you for a dance
Certainly
You are doing the waltz wonderfully well
Thanks  Im glad you say so  Oh  the music has stopped
Do you speak only English in the class  or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish
Oh  we never speak Spanish in class  MissParker speaks to us only in English
I suppose shes right  Does she speak English very slowly
Not always  Sometimes we dont understand her  Then she has to repeat what she said
It must be interesting to study English
Mario and I are the best students in the class  Miss Parker says that my pronunciation is very good
Is English pronunciation easy or difficult
Sometimes its difficult  Some words look different from the way one pronounces them
Doris  Im glad youre home  Im terrified  I dont know what to do
What is it  What happened
I think someone is stalking me
No  it cant be  Really  Who
I dont know  I saw him the first time Tuesday  He was at the cafe  I noticed he was looking at me a lot  Not just the usual looking  but staringHe just kept staring at me  He didnt stop
What did you do
I didnt do anything  Finally  he leftBut then I saw him again today  Outside the shoe store  Near the cafe  I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CDs  But then he came in too
Did he leave when you left
Yes  Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me  He was following me
What did you do
He followed me all the way home
Thats about five blocks  And around corners tooSo he was definitely following you
Yes  he was  Im not imagining itFinally  just when I got home  I turned around and looked at himHe was just standing there  He didnt smile  He just stood there  It was so obviousWhat should I do  Im so scared  Can I call the police
Actually  I dont think you can call the police  Not yet at leastHe hasnt done anything  And probably the police will just ignore itBut if anything happens again  then maybe you should call
Why cant I call the police now  He was definitely following me
Of course you can call the police if you want  Thats not what I mean  Im just saying that they probably wont do anything
I suppose  What can they do  I dont even know who he is
Listen  Carol  Dont let this bother you too muchProbably its nothing  Just keep your eyes open when you go outIf you see him a third time  and if he follows you again  then I think we should go to the policeBut for now  just try not to worry
Alright  And I wont go to that cafe for awhile
Han Maimed  Whats your plan for the weekend
I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it  To tell you the truth  I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school  It  s better to get to know it  What about you
I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays
Oh  my God  John  I didn  t know you are religious  You just look like a scientific kook  like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory
Come on  Han Maimed  don  t make a fuss  A lot of Americans  including many scientists  believe in religion
But I  m really surprised  I thought science and religion are not compatible  are they
Yes  they are compatible  Actually  the U  S  is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world
Ive heard about it a little bit before  but I don  t understand  How can people believe in God since they know God doesnt exist
That  s a little complicated  You  ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U  S  history later on  Religion was and is a part of American people  s life  Guess what  Even Harvard University  which is a highly academic institution  is in a sense the product of religion
Really
Absolutely  It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England
Why was it founded by the Puritans  Where were the atheistic educators
Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans
How come  I mean why most of them were religious people
That  s because in the 16th and 17th century  there was a series of religious reforms in England  Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries
So  you mean people didnt enjoy religious freedom in England
Yes  thats why Puritans moved to the New World  where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans  Later on  it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College
Why did they want to found a college
Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England  They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well
Oh  I see
Actually Harvard was first named  New College   without a formal name
When did it begin to be called Harvard University
In 1639  it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard  Interestingly  JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman
It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion
Therefore  it  s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion  there would note Harvard
Wow  I didn  t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history
Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U  S
I finally begin to get to know Harvard  It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor  I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard
Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States  So you have to know the U  S  history and culture if you want to have indepth knowledge of Harvard  The two are closely related
That  s right  I have a lot to learn from you
You can ask me any question at any time
I am not convinced by your explanation  Could you explain it
Sorry  I really cant do that  Theres little time left for us
I cant accept your excuse  Its five oclock
But I have an appointment with Ann
Ok  sounds good  But I think its your trick
What do you do in summer
I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride  I love being out in the fresh summer air  How about you
I don  t often go for walks  but I either play sports outsideyou know  tennis or badmintonor just sit in the sunshine and read a good book
What do you do in winter
Well  I play sports indoors quite often  If I  m feeling lazy  I just watch a film at home  I prefer summer to winter
I think most people do  I like wearing nice  colorful clothes in summeryou know  a nice dress or skirt  It  s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter
Yes  I like wearing shorts in summer  My legs would freeze
Do you think we  ll have a nice summer this year
Thanks to global warming  it could be hotter than ever
I will never forget Linda  After all  she was my first lover
I think you  ll lay it to rest with the time flying
I remember that someone says that it is difficult to forget the people who don  t want to forget
But I think time can change everything
Could you tell me what university you want to go to  John
Pardon
What university would you enter
University  Why  You asked me last year
Oh  I forgetSorry
I went to Harvard University
Did you  And what course did you take there
God save me  Is there anything wrong with you  Didnt I tell you
Ive not knownPerhaps  Ive got a bad memory
I did a B  A  in economicsRemember
Terrific  B  A   again and againB  A
Ive been chosen to plan the next family reunion
Fun for you  Do you get to do anything you want
Yep  And I should start planning now
Does everyone usually show up for your family reunions
Just about  There are at least a few hundred in our immediate family alone
How Ay days will the reunion be
Usually its at least five days and four nights
This is going to be a major production for you
Hi  my name is Lean  and Im from Russia
Nice to meet you  LvanMy name is Alike  Im from Japan
To me English is a difficult language
A second language is always difficult
True  but English is harder than mostIt  s a crazy language
A crazy language  Why do you say that
One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings
No wonder you say English is a crazy language
What did you think of the film
I liked it  I thought it was great
Yes  I liked it  too  Did you like the acting
Yes  I thought it was excellent  Didnt you
Not really  I thought it was disappointing
Its a nice cinema  isnt it
Do you think so  I dont like it very much  I found it rather uncomfortable
What  s up  You don  t look too good
Yeah  my head hurts  that  s all  I  Ve been in physics class all day  It  s killer
I liked physics  It  s all math  really  arcs  curves  velocity  cool stuff
Yeah  yeah  but today  s lesson was all about the creation of the universe
A physics class about the creation of the universe  That  s some pretty unscientific language there  Sounds more religious to me
It  s all religion  Take the theory of the Big BangHow is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion  That  s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff
Turtles  Whatever  Look  all that  s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and antiparticles  At least  that  s what the math says
Math  sheath  What  s the evidence
There is evidence  You know Edwin Hubble  He  s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe  thus advancing notions of an expanding universe  What would it be expanding from  Well  the Big Bang  DUH
Anyway  it  s just a theory  Why do people go around touting theories  Where  s the scientific rigor in that
Dude  don  t equivocate  A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing  You slept through class  didn  t you
Which film shall we see
There is nothing good at the momentLet  s do something differentWould you like to go to a concert
Yes  Id love toHere is a good one  Mozart and BeethovenIt  s on the Festival HallShall we go there
Fine  Do you want anything to eat now
No  Im not hungry
Well  lets go and have something to drink instead  I know a good place  Its a little expensive  but its fun
Everyone wants to be financial lose kill  You must invest your savings if you planed to retire rich  I  m thinking about buying stocks  It can be a good investment if I can manage well  What do you say
I partly agree with you  Buying stocks is not difficult  but making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult  Even professionals don  t find it easy  so be careful  Anyway  people like us need help with investing  Why not do some online research  There are data  reports and discussion forums to educate people on how to invest  In addition  you need to visit an established website that offers stock charts
Wow  you sound very professional
I just watched the investment TV program last weekend  It has become a very hot topic these days  Actually I am not even a beginner
Can I borrow your suit
Thats out of the question
Bill  how can you hear so happy today
Aha  Ive read of my roommate  I made a move today
Really  What was the matter
You knew Brain Locker
Brain Locker  No  I dont think so  What does he look like
Well  hes thin and tall  He has brown hair  a holt nose  green eyes and wearing glasses
Mm  Ive seen him a couple of times  I think
Where are you from
Im from Guangzhou
Where in China is Guangzhou
Its in the South of China
Well  I must be off now  I have an appointment at six
In that case  I won  t keep you any longer  Drop in anytime
Ok  Goodbye
See you later
Hey  How was your first day of class  I  m in level two and I  m loving my class this semester  It  s great being in a class of international students
Mine was ok  except that no one in my class speaks English  I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester
That  s both fortunate and unfortunate  It  s the United Nations in my class  We have people from all over the world  There are three Germans  a Pole  a Scottish  two French  an American  a Brazilian
That  s quite the array of nationalities  Everyone in my class is from Asia  except me  There are a few South Koreans  several Japanese  Malaysian  Thai  Singaporean  Filipino  Kazakhstan  and o
Well  I think you  re pretty lucky actually  You  ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture
I guess so  but I think it  s going to be hard to relate to my classmates  especially with the language barrier  I think I might change classes
Don  t  Stay the course  Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful  I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice
I highly doubt it  Your girlfriend is Chinese
Well  there is that  yes
Hey  Im hungry  How about you
Yeah  I can really go for some Chinese food right now
Thats a great idea  Lets go to a Chinese restaurant
I know one  Lets go
Good morning  Miss Li
Morning  Mike
I  m sorry that I was absent yesterday
I  Ve already got your certificate for sickleave  How do you feel today
I feel much better now
Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday
I  Ve already got it  Thanks
I will explain it in detail in the next class  Could you preview it
I will
Do you like flowers
Of course  I like
Whats your favorite flower
Forsythia  Its also called winter jasmine which is the symbol of the springs arrival
Spring is a lively season
Yes  How about you
I admire plum blossoms very much  It seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter
You have a perfect taste
It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow  I admire the bravery of plum blossoms
But it used to be ignored by many people
The bright people will remember it forever
Well  its snowing  Lets enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing
What is the weather like today
It stops snowing  but theres a bit wind
And the streets are covered with ice  Do you know what the temperature is today
I missed todays weather for cast in the radio
It seems 10 degree below zero at least  I dont mind the cold weather  but do hate when it get slippery
The ice is soon be thick for skating  Im so fine to want a sport
Thats fine  lets go skating together tomorrow
What kind of music do you like listening to
I like music that has a fast beat and is lively  like dance music  You know  I go to a disco almost every week  Sometimes its too loud though  You prefer classical music  don  t you
Yes  I do  I find it very relaxing  I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work
I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music  It  s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music
Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain  Research suggest that it makes your brain more active  Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better
Really  Perhaps I should listen to classical music often  I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress
Yes  That  s why I listen to it in the evenings  I usually play it as background music while I  m cooking or doing other housework
I  Ve got a few classical music CD  s  I should follow your lead and increase my brian power
You can find plenty of recording on the internet too  You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them
That  s a good idea  You should do the same with some music  You might find something you like  Classical music might make you clever  but dance might make you livelier and happier
That  s true  There  s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people  Music can influence a person  s feeling and character
There is a new coffee shop opening up down the street
I hope that they have a good menu  Most coffee shops only have coffee and Danish
Thats right  You dont drink coffee  do you
No  so its usually boring to join my friends in the afternoon at a regular coffee shop
What kind of things would you like to see on the menu
Maybe a fruit salad and a few different hot sandwiches at least
That shouldnt be too difficult  Since this is a small neighborhood  maybe they will take this suggestion
Lets try it
Darling  I have news for you  Bobby and his wife  Evelyn  are going to have a baby soon
Really  I thought his wife couldn  t have a baby
Actually they  re expecting the baby to come on my birthday
Oh  what a coincidence  I bet Bobby must be very happy about it  He likes children and always wants a child of his own
In fact  they  re both very excited about the coming baby  Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like  since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese
Oh  right  Now I know why they would want to see our boy  It  s hard to imagine the wonder  Are they expecting a boy or a girl
It  s still a mystery  Because Evelyn is only threemonth pregnant  But she begins to take her maternity leave now
Oh  You mean she doesn  t have to work now  It  s hard for young parents not to overreact  isn  t it
Well  I am a regular member of this club
Do you have to pay to join
Yes  membership fees vary depending on the club but usually they run into tens of thousands of dollars
Wow  that much  Dont they have any public courses
Very few  unfortunately
How was your game today
Extremely good  I shot a 78  including 5 birdies
Congratulations  Whats your normal handicap
Ten  How did your game go
My drives were terrible today  I kept slicing the ball into the roughs and sand traps
Maybe you can correct it by going to a driving range before you play again
The concert was really great
I agree
The singing group used to be very popular
I cant believe they would play so good
I have tickets to The Phantom of the Opera on Friday night  Would you like to go
Thanks  Id love to  What time is the show
Its at 8 00
That sounds great  So  do you want to have dinner at 600
Uh  Id like to  but I have to work late
Oh  thats OK  Lets just meet at the theater before the show  around 730
That sounds fine
Is the Chinese team taking the lead
No  its the Japanese team
Japanese teams always play a dark horse
Well  their team work is well worth learning
Do you mind if I ask your friend out
Of course  but we arent going out  were just friends
Okay  thats good
Do you want me to put in a good word for you
Harry is so down that he wont talk to anyone
I know only too well what thats like
What do you mean
I was very sad when I was laid off last year
Hi  Is that David
Hi  Jenny  Its David here
Hey  whats new
Not much  My girlfriend just dumped me
Sorry to hear that  What happened
Well  she told me things just weren  t working out and we weren  t right together  But I thought things were just great  Why did she say this  Its completely out of the blue
Hey  that  s not the girl with pink hair  is it  The girl I saw with Jack yesterday
What  She was cheating on me with that ugly guy  Oh  no  I feel like such a loser
Hey  she is not worth it  Forget her
But she lied to me
Hey  she is not worth it  Anyway  there are plenty more fish in the sea  Listen  lets go for a drink in the town  How about that
Ok  then
But you have to promise me that you are not gonna wear that face
What face
The one where you look like your dog just died  You have to get over her and the sooner the better
Yeah  I know  You are right
This is a nice set of wheels  How much did the dealer charge you for this
A lot  I probably got to moonlight for the rest of my life  but so what  it  s worth it  Come on  get in  Let  s take a drive
Okay then  let  s go fast  Whoa  This thing can really accelerate fast
Check out what happens when I put on the brakes suddenly  It can stop quickly
Hey  just watch out for cops or you  re gonna end up in the slammer  You know you tend to go fast
Yes  I know it  I went through my last set of tires fast  I even had three flat tires in two weeks
Now watch  some guys probably run a light and hit your car
Cut out  would you
Whens your birthday
Its just around the corner
Bob is getting on in years
Yeah  Im very worried about his health
He looks tired all the time
Hes working too hard
Which church do you attend
I am Mormon  so I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
What  s the difference between this and other Churches
Mormons believe that  after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10  their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men  In 1830  a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church
Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt
That means that they all have parts of the original gospel  but not all
Do you believe that Mormons have all of it
Yes
Why do you really go to church
We gather together to encourage each other  because we have common beliefs  We come together and call it church
Sorry I was late for the meeting today  I got stuck in traffic
Thats okay  Better late than never
Hello  What are you reading about in the newspaper
Hello  I was exhausted some studying  so I decided to read the newspaper to relax  Unfortunately  the news is so depressing  There has been another murder in the city center  I  m shocked that the police haven  t caught the killer yet
People are starting to get frightened by it  Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder
You mean  if  they catch the murderer  I  m scared stiff about going into the city center at night
There must have been some good news in the newspaper  I can  t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited
Well  there was one good piece of news  You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease
Yes  Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states
Well  they  Ve got the money and she  s going tomorrow for treatment
I  m so happy for the family  They must be very relieved and excited about that
I  m sure they are  Oh  and a local man won the lottery  I  m so jealous  I wish it were me  I buy a lottery ticket every week and I  m amazed that I haven  t even won a small prize yet  It  s so unfair
Don  t be moody  I hope you  re not tired  because we  Ve been invited to a party this evening  I know how excited you get about parties
Hi  Tom  Want to go to play bowling tonight
Sounds good  When and where shall we meet
Let me see  How about 630 at the gate of the club
Fine  see you then

That is just a natural  grammatical English expressionIt has a direct translation in other languages
This is interesting  MsParker
Why did the teacher criticise Myra in front of the whole class
Because Myra was cheating on exams  and she spoke back rudely
I dont think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher  I know she was angry  but thats still no excuse for rudeness
Do you know where I can park

I want a space on campus
Theres a parking structure for students

When was that
Sometime this morning
Would it be full now
I am really not sure
Have you heard of the Love Bug
Do you mean the  I love you  virus that attacks computers through email
Yes  It is one of the most harmful computer viruses in the world  People say it will break out again om Valentines  Day this year
This is terrible  Why do hackers play such a dirty trick
Hackers are smart  and they want people to know about it
So they create viruses to tell people they are smart  Thats really sick

I know that they are auspicious fish  Its quite popular nowadays
For Gods sake  Its too bloody  How can people be so cruel
Not at all  I think the tattoos are so cool and chic
You cant prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people
Honey  its not so serious  Its just an animal
Just an animal  But it has life too  If you want a tattoo  get one  Its your choice because you want it  But has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one
OK  I understand  but what else could we do

Okay
I saw an interesting program on TV last night  It was about elderly people
And what did the program say
It said that people with a positive attitude 7 tend to live longer and happier
I think that many physicians 8 now agree with that idea
And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress
And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise  My father is over 60 years old  and he lifts weights every day
Did you see the information on sales for last year  The sales review was made at our last board meeting  Theres a great news for our shareholders
Yeah  I went over the figures this morning  Were finally started making money again
Weve never sold this much before  our growth this year has been phenomenal  We have captured 8  of the market  up from last year by 120   Our strategy is working
not only our annual sales brake a record  but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well  After a twoyear slump  we finally back in the black
The companys performance has improved since Wallace became president  Hes made our little business into a real lucrative operation  Products are selling like hotcakes
I think our success is partly because of Wallaces contribution  and partly because of our new marketing strategy  Because of the new advertising campaign  we have become the top sellers in the field
Lets hope this stroke of good luck lasts  I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good
Lets hope it is
What a letdown  I wanted to experience some Mafia culture firsthand
Its worth it just to go and eat what the mafia eat  The fivedollar tiramisu is a culinary orgasm
Such a thing exists
Fortunately  yes  Youre blushing
Am I  Um  my face gets red when I walk too fast
Youre embarrassed  arent you  You gotta loosen up in Little Italy  The lady at the cafe will kiss you when you meet her
Did you get any rewards or honors in college
Yes  I received the scholarship 3 times on end
Did you join the Communist Party of China  CPC
Yes  I joined the CPC when I was a freshman
Your brand new car is so excellent  I like it very much
Let  s go for a joy ride
Are you watching the soccer match tonight  It must be the most exciting one in this season
Well  of course I can  t miss it  Which team are you for
Manchester United  What about you
Me too  Do you think they are going to get the championship this time
I have confidence in them
The weekends finally here
And its a long one  I have Monday off  Its Memorial Day or something like that
Yep  Its the kickoff of the barbecue season  Were invited to a grill party in the park tomorrow
Sounds good  What do we need to bring
We need to buy some buns for the hot dogs and hamburgers  and Im making potato salad
Ill dig out the Frisbee and my kite from Taiwan
Hi  Martin  I  Ve been looking for you all morning
What  s up
I want to say goodbye  I  m leaving for America tomorrow
America  Did you get admit to MIT
Yes
Congratulations  Susan  I  m so happy for you
Thank you
Really going to miss you
Me too  I  ll write to you once I get settled  But I have so much to do  You might have to wait a while  But I really will write to you  I love to write letters  I think it  s more meaning than the emails even than the phone call
Ok  Take care  Have a nice journey
Thank you
Look after yourself  Bye
Bye
You know  Taylors been in the hospital for a couple of days
And Im the one who put him there with my football moves
But youre not to blame for them keeping him there
Yeah  what was all that stuff about running tests about anyway
Im not sure  but we can find out  I bought some crosswords to keep him busy
Great  then lets go visit him  I want to give him some flowers  too  to say sorry
Did you see Ally Mabel last night
Yes  I did  Did you
Yes  wasnt it funny
Oh yes  I loved it  Wasnt the scene with the judge great
Ha  yes  brilliant
Look out  Your tea water is running over
Oh  would you please turn off the fire  My hands are sticky with the dough
Sure
Thanks
Did you see May today
Yes  but why does she have such a long face
I dont have the foggiest idea
I thought shed be happy
Yeah  especially since she got a promotion recently
I dont know  Maybe it  s some kind of personal problem
I dont think the teacher had a right to say that  The teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class
Youve got to be joking  Its the teachers right to say anything wants  and if she saw Myra cheating  she certainly had the right to say so
I agree she had the right to say something  but I feel she should have done it privately
Youre right  If I were the teacher  I wouldnt have done that
Come on in  I am so glad you are here  We have been expecting you
Am I late for the party  Looks everyone is already here  Hope I didn  t miss something interesting
No  you are just on time  We haven  t really started yet
Great  here are some flowers for you  I hope you like them  I was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment
Thank you  they  re beautiful  You can hang your coat over there  Try this new couch  it is so comfortable  You will love it  Want something to drink  tea  coffee  juice or Cola
Don  t bother  I will help myself
Make yourself at home
It is such a nice place
Well  I don  t mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments  Look  they are making photos now of my designed kitchen
Steven  would you like to go dance with us tonight
John  I am just not in the mood for this
You look so upset  Whats going on
I lost the table tennis game yesterday
Oh  what a pity
I just don  t want to play table tennis any more
Is it that bad  It  s nothing more than a game
My opponent bowled me with the very first ball  I was wondering if its appropriate for me to play table tennis
Oh  come on  Failure is the mother of success  Don  t lose heart  Im sure youll succeed
Perhaps you are right  But I still need some time to recover from the failure
I understand
The band is pretty good  How do you like the music
Its very nice  I havent heard live music in a while  This is fun
Well  then  may I invite you for the next dance
Of course  But Im afraid Im not much of a dancer
Dont worry  Im not much of a dancer myself
Youre dancing so well
You dance beautifully too
When did you learn to dance
In college  But I dont dance very often  Whats your favourite dance
Its hard to say  It depends  But I love the waltz
How about tango
Oh  I like it  Its such a beautiful dance  but I cant do it well  What about you
Tango is my favorite  Anything but hiphop or the foxtrot   the music has stopped
Thank you for the dance
My pleasure  Lets go and have a drink
OK
I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution
Yes  I agree  The air here is much more polluted than in my country  Of course  my country is more agricultural and has much less industry
We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years  but cars are still a major source of them  Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced
The problem is now on a truly global scale  I dont believe that any single country can do anything about it
I think youre right  There needs to be an international response to this problem
I just had a terrible week
What a shame
I fell down and hurt my arm
Thats too bad
Then my son drove into a tree
Im sorry to hear that
The dog bit the delivery boy
What a pity
And a storm blew our roof away
Ho  no
I  m so excited  mother  Oh  a new baby
My first grandchild
And my first nephew  He looks a lot like you  mum  He does
Do you think so  Well  I guess  He does look a lot like me  Oh  he  s got Richard  s eyes though
Yes  he does have Richard  s eyes  The baby even looks like you than Richard does
Well  children usually resemble their parents
It  s true  Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways  And she is shy with new people just like he is
You often like comparing children with their parents
You  re right
When do you go to bed usually
I go to bed at ten and get up at six
Thats helpful for your health
Sure
Have you been ever been to Disneyworld
When I was young  my parents took me to the one in California  I always forget which  is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld
The one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland  so you must have been to Disneyland
Thats right  Why do you ask
Well  Ive never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon
When are getting married
Some time next year  We havent set the date yet
Congratulations  I had no idea
Thank you  So what do you think  Would we have a good time
Do you like amusement parks
For the most part  yes  Some of the rides are bit too scary for me  though
If you dont think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can  youll have a good time
Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark
Even those  Itll be very romantic  I think  Youll have loads of fun
Thanks for the advice  Ill talk to my fiance about it tonight
Im sure hell love the idea  Just throw yourself into it and youll enjoy it
Can you speak French
Yes  I can  but not very well
Can you understand your Spanish teacher
More or less  How well do you understand Mr  Wang  your Chinese teacher
About 40 percent  if he speaks slowlyWhen he speaks fast  I can only catch a word here and there  But Mr  Wang is an excellent Chinese teacherWith his help  my Chinese is getting better and better e
you look better today  How did your test go
much better than it did yesterday
did you pass
I not only passed my test  but I aced it  Im so happy
you should be  You worked really hard last night preparing for it
thanks for helping me with it  If you hadnt encouraged me to do my best  I wouldnt have ever been able to pass
you dont have to thank me  Its just a part of my job as your counsellor
did you always do well at school
no  in fact  I was terrible at taking exams
really
sure  but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that I could and that helped me a lot  When are your final exams
Ill get my finals in two months
when do you plan on studying for those exams
most students just cram the night forehead
do you think thats a good idea
no  I think I should study a little bit at a time  starting a few weeks before the exam
that sounds like a good idea  What are you going to do if you have any questions while youre studying
Ill go and talk to my professor or a learning support assistant
it sounds like youve learned something useful this year
Can I borrow your Cds for our school dance
Oh  you dont ask much  do you
I promise I will personally guard every single one and they will come back in perfect condition
Ill tell you what  Your class can rent them from me for the night and buy back any damaged ones
That sounds fair  Thats still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us
Not as fun though  A live band is way more exciting
Our class doesnt have enough money  We already checked into it
Let me know with your next dance  I know a band that may give you a break for the publicity
Do you want to go to the beach tonight
Sure  which beach are we going to
I wanted to go to Malibu beach
I like Santa Monica
The water there looks so dirty
I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica
I like the pier too  because its beautiful at night
Is Malibu beach nice
Its a lot nicer  and I really like it better
So you want to go to Malibu
If thats okay with you
Sure  lets go to Malibu
There are so many environment problems in the world today  Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world
I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action  but I doubt it  ll happen before it  s too late
We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere  There  s lots of clean  modern technology  but companies in developed countries say it  s expensive  Developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection
Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term  rather than the long term  It  s the same with the destruction of the rainforests  Countries and companies just want the wood  They  re not thinking about the longterm damage to the forests  We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life
In other parts of the world  especially in Africa  there is a problem with desertification  Climate change and overfarming are causing farmland to turn into desert  In means that people cannot grow enough food
It also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains  Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people
Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment  You could get involved with projects to improve the environment
I think I  d like to do that  I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies
Kathy  How are you  Its been ages  What are you doing these days
I just opened my own restaurant  Im also head chef
Youre kidding  Youve always hated cooking
Well  I used to hate cooking  but now I love it
When did you change your mind
After I tried French food  Before that  I used to cook really boring things for my family
I still cant believe it  So  did you go to cooking school or something
Yeah  I went to California to study
Really  How long did you stay there
I was there between 88 and 90
And what did you do after that
Then I came back here  I worked for about three years to get some experience
Susan  I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend
A house warming party
Yes  Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn
Congratulations  That  s wonderful  I bet both of you are quite happy
Well  we have always dreamed of owning our own home  but real estate 1 in this area is extremely expensive
I understand  That  s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town  far from the city
That  s a good idea if you can find employment nearby
I agree  That  s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine  or Wisconsin
What can I do for you
I am trying to find this book
What  s the problem
It doesn  t seem like this library has it
Have you checked the computer
I have already
What did it say
It says the book is on the shelf  but I didn  t find it there
I can always borrow the book from another library
You can do that
I  ll make the call and contact you when it gets in
That  s fantastic  Thank you

Spring Festival is the most important festival in China  isnt it
Yes  thats true
How long is the holiday
It dependsBut usually its about 15 days
Do you eat any special food for the festival
Yes  dumpling is a mustThere is also other foodFor example  people eat chicken for good luck

Yes  its really wonderful
Oh  great  I hope I can spend this Spring Festival with you here in Beijing
Im sure youll have a good time
Im really sick of waiting for a bus
YeahEspecially when you have something urgent to do
But a taxi costs too much
Thats true
I feel absolutely horrible  My temperature is 41 degrees Celsius  and Ive got a headache and a runny nose
do you have any other symptoms
Ive also got a terrible stomachache  Is my face still swollen
just a little  Has your toothache gone now
yes  for the most part  It doesnt feel as bad as my other ailments  anyway
how about your tongue  Does it still hurt
no  the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away  I think its already healed
how did you get that burn again
I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago
you havent had much luck lately  have you
no  but Im sure Ill get better soon
whens the last time you took your tablets
I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch
I think its time you took another does of each  What would you like to drink with them
just some water  please  Do you have any ointment for my nose  It feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much
sure  Ill just go and get it now  what would you like to eat  Some soup
that sounds good
soup always makes me feel better when Im sick  I hope it makes you feel better  too
I havent got enough evidence for prosecuting him
Why dont you find someone who is in the know
Im just thinking about that  but the trouble is  I dont know who is well in the know
Did you ask his former secretary  Lora  She knows a lot about him
Thanks for reminding me  Shes the right person to help me
What are you two doing in here
We heard you werent feeling well  so we came to check on you
I was sitting there giving out nametags and all of a sudden  there she was
Who  Femi  Yeah  Yijun saw her inside
All these memories of prom night came back to me  I had to be alone  You remember that night
I remember someone spiked my punch  You sat with me in the girls bathroom
Youre not looking happyWhat  s the matter
Oh  nothing special  Im just a bit tired
With the job
With everything  with everybody  with all this
A good suggestion for youYou need a holiday
It wasnt always like this  you know
What do you mean
Well  I meanWe always do the same thingThere  s no variety in our lives
You need a holidayThat  s whats the matter
Certainly  perhaps
Oh dear  Miss  you are soaked  Wow  its really raining heavily outside
Yes  it sure is  I had to run here from work  I need to rush as Im on my lunch break
Well please  why dont you go ahead of me in line  Im in no hurry
Oh  thats so nice of you  Thank you very much
My pleasure Miss  Actually  could you recommend what to eat here  Ive never been here before
Sure  Well  the avocado sandwich is delicious  and its the healthiest thing on the menu  Personally  I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice  I usually get that  Also  the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town
Well  thanks for the suggestions
Oh  dont mention it
Dad  whats the date
Its December eighteenth
In seven days it will be Christmas Day
Yes  I know that
So  can I buy some new shoes as a Christmas present
Sure  a promise is a promise
What happen  John
Nothing
Why do you look unhappy
I  m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off
Oh  cheer up  He  ll understand you
This man is your fiance  Dolly
Yeah  how do you like him
Hes handsome
Can you give me a touch of his character
Hes outgoing and honest  but sometimes hes a bit conservative
Do you think I should buy this now and bring it with us
Dont bother  those are a dime a dozen where we are going
Brooke  are you still mad  Is your mom mad
No  mom said that well have the wedding at home on the 2nd  So lets hope your mom is right about that being a lucky day
It will be  And today is  too  I just talked to the airlines
Theyre going to give us back the seats
No  theyre giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in
Hawaii  My dream honeymoon destination
You got it  Well fly there directly from Texas
Oh  Jack  Thats wonderful
The world changes  the family changes too
What do you mean
People now like a small family composed of two parents and one child
That is called a nuclear family
I dont like such a family
What kind of family are you like
I like a family composed of many people  It includes grandparents  parents  aunts and uncles  and children
Its a traditional family  It may be too large to live well
We can live well  I think
What was that all about
We had a difference of opinion
Is she going to be okay
Shell be fine
Is sailing fun
You bet
John dates her seven times a week
Really  Thats a straws in the wind
I think so  Maybe hes fallen for her
Yeah  They suit each other  A perfect match between a man and a girl
Right
I was told my friend Joe was speaking ill of me  Thats a real letdown
I dont think Joe has done such a thing  Dont believe things in haste
Maybe I should go and ask him whether its true
Good morning  Loans
Good morning  Mr  Smith
I would like to compliment you on your diligence
Well  thank you  Mr  Smith  But I was just doing my job
Yes  And were proud of you  Loans
Its nice of you to say so
Which countries have you been to
I  Ve been to most of the countries in Europe  several countries in asiachina  Japan  korea  and Thailandand to the united states and Canada
I thought you had been to Australia too
No  but I  m planning on visiting Australia and new Zealand soon  I  Ve heard that they are beautiful countries  Which is the most beautiful country you  Ve been to
I think I  d say norway  It has many picturesque fjords  waterfalls  and mountains
Isn  t it really cold there
Well  the north of Norway is almost always cold  but further south it can be fairly warm in summer  It  s a wet country  so there  s snow almost everywhere in winter
I  Ve been to other Scandinavian countries  but not to Norway  Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there
Alison  would you like to have some more
No thanks  I have had enough
Actually you havent have much
To tell you the truth  I am on the diet
That sounds ridiculous  Why
Well  I am gaining weight these days  and I have to watch my calories
Welcome to my birthday party  I am so happy you can come
Thanks for inviting me  Here is the gift for you  Happy birthday  Francis  Many more happy and healthy years for you
Thank you  shall I open it now
Yes  please do
Wow  a remote car model and my favorite brand  I really like it  That is so nice of you
Yeah  I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car  It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself
Typical you  always wanting to keep the best things for yourself  The more I appreciate the gift now
Did you read the news that  Chinas property prices rose at the fastest pace in 18 months in December  ending the year with rising fears of bubbles in the property market
No  Does the newspaper say what has caused that
Yes  It says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter on expectations of tightening politics
I think the government should make a serves of moves to cool the market
Right  The climbing property prices has become a headache for Chinese residents
I think that show biz stars have a really easy life  They have lots of money  so they can buy almost anything they want  They  re famous  so everyone loves them
I think they must have horrible lives  All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do  They must get sick of it
I bet they love it really  Sure  they complain about it  but that just gets them more publicity  doesn  t it
I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves  They only want it for their films
No way  They want publicity for themselves  so that they get invited to make more films  go to lots of cocktail parties  and even make albums  They have such an easy life  They don  t even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party
Show biz stars have plenty of expenses  That  s why they need so much money  They need million of dollars to buy big  seclude houses and wonderful dresses  I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a tshirt  but they can  t because their managers force them to wear clothes they don  t like
I don  t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars  They  re overpaid  overambitious  and overadored
I think you should give them some credit  They  re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn  They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
Come on  They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves
Hi  it is a pleasant surprise
Yeah  it  s been ages  So how have you been
Couldn  t be better  And you
Just as usual  you know
Hey  Mary  can you cut that out
Cut what out I  m not doing anything
The tapping of your pen on your desk  It  s driving me crazy
Fine  By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup
I don  t slurp my coffee  And plus  how can you hear it when you  re shouting into your phone all the time
You  Ve got to be kidding me  You  re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze
Look  we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions  and it  s probably okay to let off steam once in a while  But  it  s probably not a good idea to keep it up I  m willing to forgive and forget and if you are
Fine  Lets call a truce  Ill try to more considerate and to keep the noise down
Yeah  I  ll try to do the same  So  I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night
The weather in Beijing is just beautiful
Autumn is the best season in Beijing  you know
Yes  I can see  The summer heat is over  and the winter cold is still far away
What is the weather like in Washington at this time of this year
Autumn is also very nice in Washington
Is it very cold in winter there
No  it isnt  But sometimes it snows a lot in winter
Does it rain a lot in summer there
Oh yes  Sometimes it rains very heavilyHow about here in Beijing
Theres a lot of rain in summer  but it seldom rains in autumn
I feel its rather dry here
Thats true  Many people from the south dont like the weather here
Are you from the south
No  Im from the north  I was born in Beijing  actually
I seeso this is your hometown
Mike  come and look at this painting of shrimp  It is so simple yet so vivid
Yeah  It is incredible  Is it the work of Qi Bakshi
Yes  it is  How do you know that
Well  Qi is famous all over the world  isn  t he  Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting
Cool  What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer  free sketch or claboratestyle painting
I prefer free sketch  especially the landscape paintings  I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings
Thats true  Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature  which is an important part of Chinas traditional culture
I love this art exhibition
So do I  Let  s go to other areas to see what they have got  shall we
OK
Lousy weather  isnt it
It has stopped snowing  but its even colder
Look at the ice there hanging from the eaves
And the streets are covered with snow
Do you know what the temperature is today
I missed todays weather forecast over the TV
It feels like ten degrees below zero at least  I dont mind the cold weather but I do hate it when it gets slippery
The ice will soon be thick enough for skating  I am so fond of winter sports
Thats great  Lets go skating together tomorrow
Nick  its very nice of you to see me off
Youre welcome  Did you have a good time on this vacation
Very well  If I leave Ill miss you
Me too  Please write to me as soon as you get Boston
Im sure and I remembered your phone number  Ill call you
OK  they begin to register
Its time I left
Have a nice journey  Do give my regards to your parents
What are your working hours
Eight to twelve in the morning  two to six in the afternoon
Much better than mine
What are your hours
Mine arent fixed  Sometimes I do the day shift  sometimes the night shift
Would it be all right if I went home next weekend
For What
Well  I want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday
Well  that sounds like it would be OK  Just be careful
Could you tell me what university you went to  Mr  Smith
I went to Yale University
Did you  And what did you study
I have a B  A  in Economics
Would you mind telling me how old you are
Im twentyseven
And could you tell me what other jobs you have had
Yes  I have worked in a bank for the last years
And what was your salary at the bank
I got  500 a week
Hi  Jane  How are you doing this morning
Im all right  thanks  Just a little tired
Late night
Yeah  I got home around two
I am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year  what do you say
Fantastic  I enjoy clubbing  especially those clubs with live bands  The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad  full of smoke  and the music is too loud  so conversations are not really possible  Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette
How did that happen
A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it  If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face
Sounds cool  But that is not what a lady should do  People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk
What do you do for a living
I  m a doctor
Really  Do you like it
Yes  I do  It  s very interesting  What  s your job
I  m a bus driver
Oh  do you enjoy it
No  I don  t really like it  It  s boring
what a nice garden  Look at these tulips
that would be a good shot  Can you take my picture here  dear  Please try to get the garden in the frame as well
all right  Would you please stand closer to the flower bed  Good  Smile  Say  cheese   OK  got you  Thats terrific
thanks  Could you take one more from this angle
no problem
now lets have one together

let me see  set the timer first and push the button  oh  come here
OK  lets have a try
cheese

yes  but its blurred and a little dark
never mind  Lets go to the falls and try again
Ok  lets go
Did you watch television last night  Charles
Yes  I did
It was a good game  wasnt it
Oh  I didnt watch the football match  I wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film
What a pity  It was quite exciting  Both teams played very well
How did it finish
It finished in a draw  What was the film like
It was quite good  But  I missed the beginning of it because I had to eat first
Did your wife enjoy it
No  she didnt  After half an hour she stopped watching and started to read a book
Hey  Vernassa  why be angry look
Its the new neighbor  I hate her guts
Ive never seen you so worked up  what did she do to you
She made another white crack about my clothes
Are you sure she was trying to put you down
Of course  I am sure
You shall go easy on her  she is new here
Just how am I supposed to do that
You shall just take it in surprise
Ive tried  but she keeps pushing my buttons
Try to pull it together  Vernassa  I am sure things will turn note  ok
I am not  she is no picnic
Well  if you think I can help  let me know
Thanks  Serena

Aside from yourself  who are the other members of the band
We have a guy who plays guitar  and another who plays bassAlthough we still haven  t found anyone to be our singer  You told me that you had some musical talent  right

That is the most beautiful sunset
Lets stop the car and enjoy it for a minute
Here is a good place  Lets get out
Wow  We dont get to see this in the city
Mother Nature is quite an artist
Look behind us at the mountains  Theyre reflecting pink
Amazing  The sun is almost gone and yet there is still color everywhere
Where is our camera  Lets see if we can catch this on film
What a nice day  Why dont we go for an outing
SureWhere would you suggest
How about going to the suburbs
Sounds good
Why didnt you tell me you had a girlfriend
Sorry  I thought you knew
But you should have told me you were in love with her
Didnt I
You know you didnt
Well  Im telling you now
Yes  but you might have told me before
I didnt think youd be interested
You cant be serious  How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her
Sorry  I didnt think it mattered
Oh  you men  Youre all the same
Hi  Bill
Hi  Jim
Where is that cool guy  Dick  I haven  t seen him for two weeks
He  s been sick since he came back from Italy
Bummer  I  m sorry to hear that  is he better now
Yes  Doctor William said that he could come back to work ASAP
Wheres Tom this evening
Hes a little sick under the weather
Really  Whats the matter with him
He has the flu
Tell him I was asking about him
I will
Maybe you should talk to the teacher
No  its no use
You never know unless you try
I know  She wont change my grade
well  I finished my last final today
the end of all the hard work for my masters  what a nice feeling to get my degree
do you want to attend the convocation
certainly  After years of hard work  I wouldnt miss it  By the way  where can I find cap and gown
do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them
oh  I think theyre provided by the school for that special day
no  those you have to provide for yourself
what do most of the students do
well  most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service  but some of the education majors have had them made  because they will be faculty members  and theyll need them f
then  I might as well have them made
Mary  dont move  Stand right there  Its a good shot  The background is very pretty
hold it a second  I want to fix my hairpin
it doesnt matter  Saycheese
heres Lisa  May I take a picture with her
Certainly  Ok  got you
Do you mind if I ask you a question
No  not at all  Go ahead
What do you do in order to improve your English
I go to movies  I go to lectures  I listen to the radio  I do lots of things  Most importantly  I practice every chance I get
It  s a good idea to have a radio  isn  t it
Sure  It  s like understanding on the telephone   you can  t see the speaker  It  s great for improving listening comprehension
It takes a long time to learn a language  doesn  t it
It certainly does  But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress
Good morning  Sue
Good morning  TomHow are you
Im fine  thanks  how about yourself
Things couldnt be betterWhere are you going now
I am heading for the library  Ive got a research project to doHow about you
Im going to the English classIt  ll start in five minutes  Ive got to run
See you later  alligator
After a while  crocodile
Is the environment a big issues in your country  It is in mine
It is in mine tooThe biggest issue is water  The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important
What methods do you use to conserve water
Water is rationed  We can only use a certain amount each month  It means that we cannot use some modern household items  like washing machines  They use too much water
I see  I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution
Yes  I agree  The air here is much more polluted than in my country  Of course  my country is more agricultural and has much less industry
We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years  but cars are still a major source of them  Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced
The problem is now on a truly global scale  I don  t believe that any single country can do anything about it
I think you  re right  There needs to be an international response to this problem
Hurry up  Time is running out
I see  I have run as fast as I can
Hi Cody  how did practicing go this week
Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn  t get a chance to memorize the second page  but I think I mastered the tricky section
Great  Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first  Good  good  This week  work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note  Now let  s take a look at this
Charles  Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here
It might work  I  ll have to hear itShow me what you  Ve done
It was horrible  I played play it much better at home
It  s just nerves  Just play the right hand for now  One two three four five six  ta ti tripleti  Good  good  Don  t forget the accidentals  The key signature says that note should be a Gsharp b
Is that better
Yes  much better  Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal  What was that
Sorry  The stretch for that octave is always hard to make
Thats ok  keep going  you  re moving ahead by leaps and bounds  Watch your dynamics  Keep your elbows lifted  Remember to stroke the keys  don  t pound  That  s better  Remember that as a pianist or any
Can you tell me the time
Its 530 by my watch
Is your watch right
Yes  Theres only a few seconds in a whole month
I heard that youre going on your first date Friday night
Are you angry  Lisa
Angry  Why would I be
Please dont tell my mom
Come on  Dating is a part of young peoples social life  Besides  youre sixteen already
Im glad that you see it that way
Do you want to borrow my coat  I have a black coat that would look smashing on you
Thank you so much  Lisa
Hi  Mary  long time no see
I heard through the grapevine that your getting married
Yes  next March
Congratulations  I hope everything works out
Jim and you are bosom friends  arent you
I wouldnt say so
What do you mean
Well  I thought he was  but he ends up to be a con man
is everything alright
yes  everything is fine
what took so long  I thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago
didnt they announce that our flight was delayed
I didnt hear anything about a delay  I thought everything was running on time  What happened
we boarded the plane on time  but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem
then what  Your plane was three hours late
we finally took off  but about 30 minutes later  the captain came on the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight
turbulence is pretty normal  isnt it
yes  but this was the worst turbulence Id ever experienced in my life  Everyone started getting sick  The flight attendants had to stay in their seats  The captain decided to land early
so where did you land
we landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again
that sounds like a nightmare
it wasnt too bad  At lease Im alive
have you had anything to eat
I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant  How about you
I had a few coffees while I was waiting  Lets get out of here
